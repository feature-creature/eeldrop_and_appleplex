It is these moments we prize, and which alone are revealing. For any vital truth is incapable of being applied to another case: the essential is unique. Perhaps that is why it is so neglected: because it is useless."
a - "...What we grasp in that moment of pure observation on which we pride ourselves, is not alien to the principle of classification, but deeper. We avoid classification. We do not deny it. But when a man is classified something is lost."
e - "I should go even further than that, the majority not only have no language to express anything save generalized man; they are for the most part unaware of themselves as anything but generalized men. This cataloging is not only satisfactory to other people for practical purposes, it is sufficient to themselves for their 'life of the spirit'. Many are not quite real at any moment."

a - "What is to be our philosophy?"
e - "Our philosophy is quite irrelevant...We must avoid having a platform... We cannot escape the label, but let it be one which carries no distinction, and arouses no self-consciousness. Sufficient that we should find simple labels, and not further exploit them."
